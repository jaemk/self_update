## [0.19.0]
### Added
- Add `Download::set_header` for inserting into the download request's headers.
### Changed
- Update readme example to add `Accept: application/octet-stream` header. Release parsing
  was updated in 0.7.0 to use the github-api download url instead of the browser
  url so auth headers can be passed. When using the github-api download url, you
  need to pass `Accept: application/octet-stream` in order to get back a 302
  redirecting you to the "raw" download url. This was already being handled in
  `ReleaseUpdate::update_extended`, but wasn't added to the readme example.
